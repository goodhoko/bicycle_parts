# Front derailleur spacer

Recently I bought a steel frame to [build kind of a neo-retro road bike](/Silver-everything)) out of it. The frame has this perverse S-shaped seat tube. It looks cool but places the front derailleur too high and forward resulting in the chain rubbing against the bottom of the cage. The cage cannot be lowered as it would interfere with the big ring. This spacer moves the derailleur back to correct position.
